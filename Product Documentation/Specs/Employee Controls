I'll analyze your employee and manager setup in the Kumbaya project to understand how it works and how it would function in a real-world interface.

Let me first examine the relevant code to understand the current implementation.

Based on my analysis of your employee and manager setup in the Kumbaya project, here's how it works and how it would function in a real-world interface:

## Current Implementation

1. **PDA Structure**: 
   - Each employee is represented by a Program Derived Address (PDA) with seeds: `["employee", merchant.key(), employee_pubkey]`
   - This creates a unique account for each employee that's deterministically derived from the merchant's account and the employee's public key

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - You have a hierarchical role system with 7 levels:
     - Owner (implicit, full access)
     - Manager3 (highest manager tier)
     - Manager2 (mid manager tier)
     - Manager1 (junior manager)
     - Employee3 (senior employee)
     - Employee2 (regular employee)
     - Employee1 (junior employee)

3. **Daily Limits**:
   - Each role has specific daily limits for withdrawals and refunds
   - Limits are tracked and reset daily
   - Higher roles have higher limits (e.g., Manager3 can withdraw up to 10,000 USDC daily)

4. **Authentication**:
   - The system uses the employee's Solana wallet (public key) for authentication
   - No password is stored on-chain - authentication is handled by the wallet's signature

## How This Would Work in a Real-World Interface

### For Merchants:

1. **Employee Management Dashboard**:
   - A merchant would have a dashboard to add, remove, and manage employees
   - They would input the employee's name and select their role
   - The system would generate a unique invitation link or QR code for the employee

2. **Role Assignment**:
   - Merchants can assign different roles based on the employee's responsibilities
   - They can update roles as employees are promoted or responsibilities change

3. **Limit Monitoring**:
   - Merchants can view daily usage of limits by employees
   - They can see transaction history and who performed what actions

### For Employees:

1. **Onboarding Process**:
   - Employee receives an invitation link/QR code from the merchant
   - They connect their Solana wallet to the platform
   - The system verifies their wallet matches the one the merchant added

2. **Authentication**:
   - Employees authenticate using their Solana wallet (no password needed)
   - This provides secure, cryptographic authentication without storing sensitive credentials

3. **Role-Based Interface**:
   - The UI would adapt based on the employee's role
   - Higher roles would see more options and higher limits
   - Lower roles would have a simplified interface with fewer options

4. **Transaction Limits**:
   - The UI would show remaining daily limits
   - It would prevent transactions that exceed limits
   - Limits reset daily automatically

## Security Considerations

1. **Wallet-Based Authentication**:
   - The system relies on the security of the employee's Solana wallet
   - No passwords are stored on-chain, reducing attack vectors
   - If an employee loses access to their wallet, the merchant can deactivate their account

2. **Role Separation**:
   - The hierarchical role system ensures employees can only perform actions within their authority
   - Critical operations might require multiple signatures or higher-level approval

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - All transactions are recorded on-chain with the employee's signature
   - This creates an immutable audit trail for compliance

## Conclusion

Your current implementation is well-designed for a role-based access control system. The use of PDAs and wallet-based authentication is a secure approach that doesn't require storing passwords on-chain. The daily limits provide a good balance between flexibility and security.

For a complete solution, you would need to build a frontend interface that:
1. Allows merchants to manage employees and their roles
2. Provides employees with a role-appropriate interface
3. Shows transaction limits and history
4. Handles the wallet connection and authentication flow

The off-chain password management you mentioned could be implemented as an additional security layer, but it would be separate from the on-chain authentication which is handled by the wallet signatures.

You're right - we can make the employee and manager limits customizable without requiring on-chain storage. Let me implement a solution that allows for customizable limits while keeping the core functionality intact.

Here's my approach:

1. Create a struct for role-based limits that can be passed as a parameter
2. Allow the merchant to define custom limits when creating employees
3. Keep the default limits as fallbacks if no custom limits are provided




Now let's update the `CreateEmployee` struct to accept custom limits:





Now let's update the `lib.rs` file to pass the custom limits parameter:




Let's fix the linter errors by importing the `RoleLimits` type:





Perfect! I've implemented a solution that allows for customizable employee limits while keeping the core functionality intact. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Added a `RoleLimits` struct in `state.rs` that defines:
   - `withdraw_limit`: The maximum amount an employee can withdraw per day
   - `refund_limit`: The maximum amount an employee can refund per day

2. Created a `get_default_limits` method that returns predefined limits based on the employee role, maintaining the original limits as defaults.

3. Updated the `CreateEmployee` struct's `init` method to:
   - Accept an optional `custom_limits` parameter
   - Use the custom limits if provided, otherwise fall back to the default limits
   - Initialize the employee's daily limits with the appropriate values

4. Modified the `create_employee` function in `lib.rs` to:
   - Accept the optional `custom_limits` parameter
   - Pass it to the `init` method

This approach gives merchants the flexibility to:
1. Use the default limits for standard roles
2. Define custom limits for specific employees
3. Create role presets off-chain and apply them when creating employees

The implementation is efficient because:
- It doesn't require on-chain storage for role presets
- It maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- It allows for easy customization without changing the core functionality

Merchants can now create employees with custom limits that match their specific security requirements, including setting lower limits for the owner when operating as an employee.

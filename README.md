## How to Use (Devnet)

1. Login via your preferred social sign-on method, or use a test account such as {test123}@test.getpara.com, where the content inside the curly braces { } is arbitrary, but the @test.getpara.com domain is required. (you don't need to use the curly braces { } in your email input)

2. Enter any numbers into the verification code challenge -- 111111 will do fine.

3. Set a mock password -- 123456789 will do fine.

4. You will need devnet SOL for now, so either send some to your account's pubkey, or click the Request Airdrop button. If the faucet is broken or has run out of funds then it might not work. In that case you will have to send some to your address, or borrow some from a friend!

5. Click Create Merchant in the top left corner.

6. Enter a Merchant name and click Create Merchant. After your Merchant is created, the Merchant's Dashboard will appear.

7. View your Merchant's Dashboard in all its glory!

8. Enter a payment amount using your keyboard input, or the numpad.

9. Enter an optional memo.

10. Scan, or have someone else scan, the SolanaPay QR code with their mobile Phantom/Backpack app. NOTE! You, or they, will need to be on DEVNET, and have DEVNET SOL and DEVNET USDC!! You can obtain devnet USDC here: https://faucet.circle.com/

11. Once you have scanned the payment QR code, review the transaction, and hit send.

12. The dashboard should toast your payment received, play the cash register sound effect, present the green checkmark/success icon, and update your Merchant's USDC account balance. A payment history record should also populate the Payment History component, with an option to refund the transaction back to the originating address.

13. You can enter an amount to withdraw from the Merchant USDC account, which will withdraw 99% of the input amount to the Owner's USDC account (your main social sign-on's address you logged in with), and 1% to the platform.

14. You can refund a payment transaction if you have enough funds, and if that transaction has not already been refunded. The program will prevent double refunds to the same original transaction signature.

15. Have a look around at our other tabs, such as Inventory Management, Revenue Payments, Treasury / Yield, USD On & Off-ramps, Project Phases, and your Merchant's devnet account history on Solscan.

16. Outside of the Merchant routes, you can find the Swap page, which is a working Jupiter Terminal connected to MAINNET! Here you can swap mainnet USDC to Perena's USD* and gain some sweet yield on your stablecoins without risk of Freeze Authorities or Permanent Delegates!

17. Give us some much appreciated feedback by using the User Experience Survey! in the bottom left corner!
